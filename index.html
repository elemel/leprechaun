    <h1>Leprechaun</h1>
    <p>Leprechaun is a public-domain mud library for
    <a href="http://www.dworkin.nl/dgd/"><acronym title="Dworkin's Generic Driver">DGD</acronym></a>
    and its kernel library. So far, the Leprechaun system library has the
    following features:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Middle-weight Objects</dt>
      <dd>Light-weight objects that emulate some properties of persistent
      objects, notably callouts. They can be used for the bulk of items in a
      mud.</dd>

      <dt>Object Numbers</dt>
      <dd>Persistent and middle-weight objects are assigned globally unique
      object numbers. Objects can be found by number. Object numbers are
      essential in avoiding automatic duplication of middle-weight objects when
      referencing them across execution rounds.</dd>

      <dt>Inventory System</dt>
      <dd>Classic inventory system with inventories, environments, and
      vetoable object movement. Only persistent objects can be environments.
      Moving an object from one environment to another is an atomic operation.
      Environments fascilitate middle-weight objects.</dd>

      <dt>Program Database</dt>
      <dd>The object manager tracks all program issues in the mud, including
      the kernel and system auto objects. The program issues can be explored as
      a directory tree using the <code>pls</code> command.</dd>

      <dt>Creator Arguments</dt>
      <dd>Pass arguments to the <code>create()</code> function when creating
      persistent clones and light-weight objects.</dd>

      <dt>Hidden Master Objects</dt>
      <dd>The master objects of clonable and light-weight objects are hidden.
      Like inheritable objects, they cannot be found or called by name.</dd>

      <dt>Atomic Object Creation</dt>
      <dd>An object can undo its creation by raising an error in the
      <code>create()</code> function.</dd>

      <dt>Restrictions on Undefined Functions</dt>
      <dd>Only inheritable objects can have undefined functions. (For now, this
      also means that objects with undefined functions cannot be privately
      inherited.)</dd>

      <dt>Idiomatic Design</dt>
      <dd>Designed with multi-processing and swapping in mind.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The Leprechaun distribution also includes a game library under
    development, intended to showcase the features of the system library. The
    game library currently has the following features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The game objects consist of rooms, creatures, and items. Items are
      further refined into weapons, armor pieces, containers, and heaps.</li>
      <li>Command parser for game commands. It generates action objects. Action
      objects can also be created programmatically, for instance by an AI.</li>
      <li>Action objects are enqueued in creatures.</li>
      <li>Dynamic attribute system with bonuses from race, guild, and
      equipment.</li>
      <li>Various utility libraries of reusable functions.</li>
    </ul>
